# SOLUTION CHANGELOG

## Revision 1

### Thought Process

- Read through the code and understood the logic.
- I had to add some comments to the code to understand the logic better.
- Usually I would use typescript, but since this is already in plain javascript, I am abusing JSDocs to make the code more readable and have at least some sort of intellisense and type check.
- I executed the tests to make sure it works.

### Code Changes

- Added some documentation and comments to the code to make it more readable.
- Created the first solution to the sync problem using brute force and experimenting how the code works.

 the `syncSortedMerge` function.
